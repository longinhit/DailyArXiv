| **[Bidirectional Cross-Perception for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21159v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage. Second, we utilize the presence score from the presence head to filter out categories that do not exist in the scene, reducing false positives caused by the vast vocabulary sizes and patch-level processing in geospatial scenes. We evaluate our method on extensive remote sensing datasets. Experiments show that this simple adaptation achieves promising performance, demonstrating the potential of SAM 3 for remote sensing OVSS. Our code is released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-OV-3.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aware Feature Rectification with Region Adjacency Graphs for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07360v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the inductive biases learned from large-scale datasets, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) leverages the power of vision-language models, such as CLIP, to achieve remarkable progress without requiring task-specific training. However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively suppresses segmentation noise, improves region-level consistency, and achieves strong performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> | Accepted to WACV2026 |
| **[Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14), partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[ReME: A Data-Centric Framework for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21233v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

| **[A Survey on Training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22209v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks in image understanding with a long history of research, and subsequently a myriad of different approaches. Traditional methods strive to train models up from scratch, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and training data. In the advent of moving to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which asks models to classify beyond learned categories, large quantities of finely annotated data would be prohibitively expensive. Researchers have instead turned to training-free methods where they leverage existing models made for tasks where data is more easily acquired. Specifically, this survey will cover the history, nuance, idea development and the state-of-the-art in training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that leverages existing multi-modal classification models. We will first give a preliminary on the task definition followed by an overview of popular model archetypes and then spotlight over 30 approaches split into broader research branches: purely CLIP-based, those leveraging auxiliary visual foundation models and ones relying on generative methods. Subsequently, we will discuss the limitations and potential problems of current research, as well as provide some underexplored ideas for future study. We believe this survey will serve as a good onboarding read to new researchers and spark increased interest in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Global Knowledge of CLIP in Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06818v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works modify CLIP to perform open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in a training-free manner (TF-OVSS). In vanilla CLIP, patch-wise image representations mainly encode homogeneous image-level properties, which hinders the application of CLIP to the dense prediction task. Previous TF-OVSS works sacrifice globality to enhance the locality of CLIP features, by making each patch mainly attend to itself or its neighboring patches within a narrow local window. With their modifications,the ability of CLIP to aggregate global context information is largely weakened. Differently, in this paper, we rethink the global knowledge encoded by CLIP and propose GCLIP to answer how to extract and utilize beneficial global knowledge of CLIP for TF-OVSS. As the representation of each patch is finally determined by the attention weights and the Value embeddings, we propose to reshape the last-block attention and Value embeddings to aggregate useful global context into final features. Firstly, we aim to equip the last-block attention with image-level properties while not introducing homogeneous attention patterns across patches. To realize the goal, we fuse the attention from the global-token emerging blocks with the Query-Query attention. Secondly, we aim to make Value embeddings of the last-block attention module more semantically correlated. To realize this, we design a novel channel suppression strategy.Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Pay Attention to Your Neighbours: Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08181v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant progress in deep learning for dense visual recognition problems, such as semantic segmentation, traditional methods are constrained by fixed class sets. Meanwhile, vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have showcased remarkable effectiveness in numerous zero-shot image-level tasks, owing to their robust generalizability. Recently, a body of work has investigated utilizing these models in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, existing approaches often rely on impractical supervised pre-training or access to additional pre-trained networks. In this work, we propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS, termed Neighbour-Aware CLIP (NACLIP), representing a straightforward adaptation of CLIP tailored for this scenario. Our method enforces localization of patches in the self-attention of CLIP's vision transformer which, despite being crucial for dense prediction tasks, has been overlooked in the OVSS literature. By incorporating design choices favouring segmentation, our approach significantly improves performance without requiring additional data, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it highly practical for real-world applications. Experiments are performed on 8 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks, yielding state-of-the-art performance on most scenarios. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sinahmr/NACLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Explore the Potential of CLIP for Training-Free Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08268v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP, as a vision-language model, has significantly advanced Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) with its zero-shot capabilities. Despite its success, its application to OVSS faces challenges due to its initial image-level alignment training, which affects its performance in tasks requiring detailed local context. Our study delves into the impact of CLIP's [CLS] token on patch feature correlations, revealing a dominance of "global" patches that hinders local feature discrimination. To overcome this, we propose CLIPtrase, a novel training-free semantic segmentation strategy that enhances local feature awareness through recalibrated self-correlation among patches. This approach demonstrates notable improvements in segmentation accuracy and the ability to maintain semantic coherence across objects.Experiments show that we are 22.3% ahead of CLIP on average on 9 segmentation benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art training-free methods.The code are made publicly available at: https://github.com/leaves162/CLIPtrase.</p></details> | ECCV24 accepted |
| **[Diffusion Model is Secretly a Training-free Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmenter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02773v3)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-image discriminative models, such as CLIP, has been explored for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with unsatisfactory results due to the loss of crucial localization information and awareness of object shapes. Recently, there has been a growing interest in expanding the application of generative models from generation tasks to semantic segmentation. These approaches utilize generative models either for generating annotated data or extracting features to facilitate semantic segmentation. This typically involves generating a considerable amount of synthetic data or requiring additional mask annotations. To this end, we uncover the potential of generative text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as highly efficient open-vocabulary semantic segmenters, and introduce a novel training-free approach named DiffSegmenter. The insight is that to generate realistic objects that are semantically faithful to the input text, both the complete object shapes and the corresponding semantics are implicitly learned by diffusion models. We discover that the object shapes are characterized by the self-attention maps while the semantics are indicated through the cross-attention maps produced by the denoising U-Net, forming the basis of our segmentation results.Additionally, we carefully design effective textual prompts and a category filtering mechanism to further enhance the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed DiffSegmenter achieves impressive results for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

| **[BayPrAnoMeta: Bayesian Proto-MAML for Few-Shot Industrial Image Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19992v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial image anomaly detection is a challenging problem owing to extreme class imbalance and the scarcity of labeled defective samples, particularly in few-shot settings. We propose BayPrAnoMeta, a Bayesian generalization of Proto-MAML for few-shot industrial image anomaly detection. Unlike existing Proto-MAML approaches that rely on deterministic class prototypes and distance-based adaptation, BayPrAnoMeta replaces prototypes with task-specific probabilistic normality models and performs inner-loop adaptation via a Bayesian posterior predictive likelihood. We model normal support embeddings with a Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW) prior, producing a Student-$t$ predictive distribution that enables uncertainty-aware, heavy-tailed anomaly scoring and is essential for robustness in extreme few-shot settings. We further extend BayPrAnoMeta to a federated meta-learning framework with supervised contrastive regularization for heterogeneous industrial clients and prove convergence to stationary points of the resulting nonconvex objective. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate consistent and significant AUROC improvements over MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore-based methods in few-shot anomaly detection settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[VTFusion: A Vision-Text Multimodal Fusion Network for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16381v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) has emerged as a critical paradigm for identifying irregularities using scarce normal references. While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15319v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) denotes the identification of anomalies within a target category with a limited number of normal samples. Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples.

| **[Understanding Cross Task Generalization in Handwriting-Based Alzheimer's Screening via Vision Language Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05841v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which early detection is critical. Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26464v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images. However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance, which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

| **[Towards Adversarial Robustness and Uncertainty Quantification in DINOv2-based Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13643v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARRML2025</p></details> |

However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Prescriptive Agents based on RAG for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomalous Samples for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23712v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular industrial anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT: Enhancing MLLMs for Industrial Anomaly Detection via Difficulty-Aware GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21619v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.</p></details> |  |

A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component.

| **[IQE-CLIP: Instance-aware Query Embedding for Zero-/Few-shot Anomaly Detection in Medical Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10730v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the rapid advancements of vision-language models, such as CLIP, leads to significant progress in zero-/few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks. However, most existing CLIP-based ZFSAD methods commonly assume prior knowledge of categories and rely on carefully crafted prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While such meticulously designed text prompts effectively capture semantic information in the textual space, they fall short of distinguishing normal and anomalous instances within the joint embedding space. Moreover, these ZFSAD methods are predominantly explored in industrial scenarios, with few efforts conducted to medical tasks. To this end, we propose an innovative framework for ZFSAD tasks in medical domain, denoted as IQE-CLIP. We reveal that query embeddings, which incorporate both textual and instance-aware visual information, are better indicators for abnormalities. Specifically, we first introduce class-based prompting tokens and learnable prompting tokens for better adaptation of CLIP to the medical domain. Then, we design an instance-aware query module (IQM) to extract region-level contextual information from both text prompts and visual features, enabling the generation of query embeddings that are more sensitive to anomalies. Extensive experiments conducted on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both zero-shot and few-shot tasks. We release our code and data at https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP/.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09254v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD2025 |
| **[Search is All You Need for Few-shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11895v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) has emerged as a crucial yet challenging task in industrial inspection, where normal distribution modeling must be accomplished with only a few normal images. While existing approaches typically employ multi-modal foundation models combining language and vision modalities for prompt-guided anomaly detection, these methods often demand sophisticated prompt engineering and extensive manual tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate that a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD scenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential components: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and discriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support augmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to address the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature integration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency local details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual memory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection. Extensive evaluations across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD benchmarks demonstrate VisionAD's exceptional performance. Using only 1 normal images as support, our method achieves remarkable image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8% respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins (+1.6%, +3.2%, and +1.4%). The training-free nature and superior few-shot capabilities of VisionAD make it particularly appealing for real-world applications where samples are scarce or expensive to obtain.

| **[Kernel-Aware Graph Prompt Learning for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17619v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) aims to detect unseen anomaly regions with the guidance of very few normal support images from the same class. Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

This paper explores whether high-quality visual features alone are sufficient to rival existing state-of-the-art vision-language models. We affirm this by adapting DINOv2 for one-shot and few-shot anomaly detection, with a focus on industrial applications. We show that this approach does not only rival existing techniques but can even outmatch them in many settings. Our proposed vision-only approach, AnomalyDINO, follows the well-established patch-level deep nearest neighbor paradigm, and enables both image-level anomaly prediction and pixel-level anomaly segmentation. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. Despite its simplicity, AnomalyDINO achieves state-of-the-art results in one- and few-shot anomaly detection (e.g., pushing the one-shot performance on MVTec-AD from an AUROC of 93.1% to 96.6%). The reduced overhead, coupled with its outstanding few-shot performance, makes AnomalyDINO a strong candidate for fast deployment, e.g., in industrial contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Due to the domain gaps between these fields, existing VAD methods are typically tailored to each domain, with specialized detection techniques and model architectures that are difficult to generalize across different domains. Moreover, even within the same domain, current VAD approaches often follow a "one-category-one-model" paradigm, requiring large amounts of normal samples to train class-specific models, resulting in poor generalizability and hindering unified evaluation across domains. To address this issue, we propose a generalized few-shot VAD method, UniVAD, capable of detecting anomalies across various domains, such as industrial, logical, and medical anomalies, with a training-free unified model. UniVAD only needs few normal samples as references during testing to detect anomalies in previously unseen objects, without training on the specific domain. Specifically, UniVAD employs a Contextual Component Clustering ($C^3$) module based on clustering and vision foundation models to segment components within the image accurately, and leverages Component-Aware Patch Matching (CAPM) and Graph-Enhanced Component Modeling (GECM) modules to detect anomalies at different semantic levels, which are aggregated to produce the final detection result. We conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning industrial, logical, and medical fields, and the results demonstrate that UniVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot anomaly detection tasks across multiple domains, outperforming domain-specific anomaly detection models.

| **[Transformer Based Self-Context Aware Prediction for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00670v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in videos is a challenging task as anomalies in different videos are of different kinds. Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

Recent AD methods have evolved with the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing few-shot anomaly detection capabilities. However, these latest AD methods still exhibit limitations in accuracy improvement. One contributing factor is their direct comparison of a query image's features with those of few-shot normal images. This direct comparison often leads to a loss of precision and complicates the extension of these techniques to more complex domains--an area that remains underexplored in a more refined and comprehensive manner. To address these limitations, we introduce the anomaly personalization method, which performs a personalized one-to-normal transformation of query images using an anomaly-free customized generation model, ensuring close alignment with the normal manifold. Moreover, to further enhance the stability and robustness of prediction results, we propose a triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy, which incorporates a comprehensive comparison between the query and generated anomaly-free data pool and prompt information. Extensive evaluations across eleven datasets in three domains demonstrate our model's effectiveness compared to the latest AD methods. Additionally, our method has been proven to transfer flexibly to other AD methods, with the generated image data effectively improving the performance of other AD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Th...</summary><p>In The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS2024)</p></details> |

Zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection do not require labeled samples from the target class in advance, making them a promising research direction. Existing zero-shot and few-shot approaches often leverage powerful multimodal models to detect and localize anomalies by comparing image-text similarity. However, their handcrafted generic descriptions fail to capture the diverse range of anomalies that may emerge in different objects, and simple patch-level image-text matching often struggles to localize anomalous regions of varying shapes and sizes. To address these issues, this paper proposes the FiLo++ method, which consists of two key components. The first component, Fused Fine-Grained Descriptions (FusDes), utilizes large language models to generate anomaly descriptions for each object category, combines both fixed and learnable prompt templates and applies a runtime prompt filtering method, producing more accurate and task-specific textual descriptions. The second component, Deformable Localization (DefLoc), integrates the vision foundation model Grounding DINO with position-enhanced text descriptions and a Multi-scale Deformable Cross-modal Interaction (MDCI) module, enabling accurate localization of anomalies with various shapes and sizes. In addition, we design a position-enhanced patch matching approach to improve few-shot anomaly detection performance. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that FiLo++ achieves significant performance improvements compared with existing methods.

To address the scarcity of data in industrial scenarios, lots of few-shot anomaly detection methods emerge recently. In this paper, we propose an effective few-shot anomaly classification (FSAC) framework with one-stage training, dubbed CLIP-FSAC++. Specifically, we introduce a cross-modality interaction module named Anomaly Descriptor following image and text encoders, which enhances the correlation of visual and text embeddings and adapts the representations of CLIP from pre-trained data to target data. In anomaly descriptor, image-to-text cross-attention module is used to obtain image-specific text embeddings and text-to-image cross-attention module is used to obtain text-specific visual embeddings. Then these modality-specific embeddings are used to enhance original representations of CLIP for better matching ability. Comprehensive experiment results are provided for evaluating our method in few-normal shot anomaly classification on VisA and MVTEC-AD for 1, 2, 4 and 8-shot settings.

To address this, we introduce a novel window self-attention mechanism based on the CLIP model, augmented with learnable prompts to process multi-level features within a Soldier-Officer Window Self-Attention (SOWA) framework.

Such a paradigm, despite its promising results, is computationally expensive and inefficient, thereby failing to meet the requirements for realworld applications. Inspired by how humans detect anomalies, by comparing a query image to known normal ones, this article proposes a novel few-shot AD (FSAD) framework. Using a training set of normal images from various categories, registration, aiming to align normal images of the same categories, is leveraged as the proxy task for self-supervised category-agnostic representation learning. At test time, an image and its corresponding support set, consisting of a few normal images from the same category, are supplied, and anomalies are identified by comparing the registered features of the test image to its corresponding support image features. Such a setup enables the model to generalize to novel test categories. It is, to our best knowledge, the first FSAD method that requires no model fine-tuning for novel categories: enabling a single model to be applied to all categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, it improves the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) for FSAD by 11.3% and 8.3% on the MVTec and MPDD benchmarks, respectively.

Deep learning (DL) models typically require large-scale annotated data, which are often highly imbalanced since anomalies are usually scarce. The black box nature of these models prohibits them from being trusted by users. To address these challenges, we propose MeLIAD, a novel methodology for interpretable anomaly detection, which unlike the previous methods is based on metric learning and achieves interpretability by design without relying on any prior distribution assumptions of true anomalies. MeLIAD requires only a few samples of anomalies for training, without employing any augmentation techniques, and is inherently interpretable, providing visualizations that offer insights into why an image is identified as anomalous. This is achieved by introducing a novel trainable entropy-based scoring component for the identification and localization of anomalous instances, and a novel loss function that jointly optimizes the anomaly scoring component with a metric learning objective. Experiments on five public benchmark datasets, including quantitative and qualitative evaluation of interpretability, demonstrate that MeLIAD achieves improved anomaly detection and localization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Identifying actors that deceitfully utilize an API poses a demanding problem. Although there have been notable advancements and contributions in the field of API security, there remains a significant challenge when dealing with attackers who use novel approaches that don't match the well-known payloads commonly seen in attacks. Also, attackers may exploit standard functionalities unconventionally and with objectives surpassing their intended boundaries. Thus, API security needs to be more sophisticated and dynamic than ever, with advanced computational intelligence methods, such as machine learning models that can quickly identify and respond to abnormal behavior. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised few-shot anomaly detection framework composed of two main parts: First, we train a dedicated generic language model for API based on FastText embedding. Next, we use Approximate Nearest Neighbor search in a classification-by-retrieval approach. Our framework allows for training a fast, lightweight classification model using only a few examples of normal API requests. We evaluated the performance of our framework using the CSIC 2010 and ATRDF 2023 datasets.

The usual unsupervised anomaly detection approach is to train a model for each object class using a dataset of normal samples. However, a more realistic problem is zero-/few-shot anomaly detection where zero or only a few normal samples are available. This makes the training of object-specific models challenging. Recently, large foundation vision-language models have shown strong zero-shot performance in various downstream tasks. While these models have learned complex relationships between vision and language, they are not specifically designed for the tasks of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose the Few-shot/zero-shot Anomaly Detection Engine (FADE) which leverages the vision-language CLIP model and adjusts it for the purpose of industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, we improve language-guided anomaly segmentation 1) by adapting CLIP to extract multi-scale image patch embeddings that are better aligned with language and 2) by automatically generating an ensemble of text prompts related to industrial anomaly detection. 3) We use additional vision-based guidance from the query and reference images to further improve both zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection. On the MVTec-AD (and VisA) dataset, FADE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in anomaly segmentation with pixel-AUROC of 89.6% (91.5%) in zero-shot and 95.4% (97.5%) in 1-normal-shot.

With the evolving of time, the types of anomaly edges are emerging and the labeled anomaly samples are few for each type. Current methods are either designed to detect randomly inserted edges or require sufficient labeled data for model training, which harms their applicability for real-world applications. In this paper, we study this problem by cooperating with the rich knowledge encoded in large language models(LLMs) and propose a method, namely AnomalyLLM. To align the dynamic graph with LLMs, AnomalyLLM pre-trains a dynamic-aware encoder to generate the representations of edges and reprograms the edges using the prototypes of word embeddings. Along with the encoder, we design an in-context learning framework that integrates the information of a few labeled samples to achieve few-shot anomaly detection. Experiments on four datasets reveal that AnomalyLLM can not only significantly improve the performance of few-shot anomaly detection, but also achieve superior results on new anomalies without any update of model parameters.</p></details> | 13pages |

Previous approaches often rely on annotations or true abnormal samples to improve detection, but such textual or visual cues are not always accessible.

AnoPLe simulates anomalies and employs bidirectional coupling of textual and visual prompts to facilitate deep interaction between the two modalities. Additionally, we integrate a lightweight decoder with a learnable multi-view signal, trained on multi-scale images to enhance local semantic comprehension.

However, existing FSAD methods encounter difficulties leveraging a limited number of normal samples, frequently failing to detect and locate inconspicuous anomalies in the spatial domain. We have further discovered that these subtle anomalies would be more noticeable in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Path Frequency Discriminators (DFD) network from a frequency perspective to tackle these issues. The original spatial images are transformed into multi-frequency images, making them more conducive to the tailored discriminators in detecting anomalies. Additionally, the discriminators learn a joint representation with forms of pseudo-anomalies.

Existing efforts in graph anomaly detection typically only consider the information in a single scale (view), thus inevitably limiting their capability in capturing anomalous patterns in complex graph data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, graph ANomaly dEtection framework with Multi-scale cONtrastive lEarning (ANEMONE in short). By using a graph neural network as a backbone to encode the information from multiple graph scales (views), we learn better representation for nodes in a graph. In maximizing the agreements between instances at both the patch and context levels concurrently, we estimate the anomaly score of each node with a statistical anomaly estimator according to the degree of agreement from multiple perspectives. To further exploit a handful of ground-truth anomalies (few-shot anomalies) that may be collected in real-life applications, we further propose an extended algorithm, ANEMONE-FS, to integrate valuable information in our method. We conduct extensive experiments under purely unsupervised settings and few-shot anomaly detection settings, and we demonstrate that the proposed method ANEMONE and its variant ANEMONE-FS consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Supervised learning under a close-set setting and industrial anomaly detection, as two common paradigms in VII, face different problems in practical applications. The former is that various and sufficient defects are difficult to obtain, while the latter is that specific defects cannot be located. To solve these problems, in this paper, we focus on the few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) method, which can locate unseen defects conditioned on a few annotations without retraining. Compared to common objects in natural images, the defects in VII are small. This brings two problems to current FSS methods: 1 distortion of target semantics and 2 many false positives for backgrounds. To alleviate these problems, we propose a small object few-shot segmentation (SOFS) model. The key idea for alleviating 1 is to avoid the resizing of the original image and correctly indicate the intensity of target semantics. SOFS achieves this idea via the non-resizing procedure and the prototype intensity downsampling of support annotations. To alleviate 2, we design an abnormal prior map in SOFS to guide the model to reduce false positives and propose a mixed normal Dice loss to preferentially prevent the model from predicting false positives. SOFS can achieve FSS and few-shot anomaly detection determined by support masks. Diverse experiments substantiate the superior performance of SOFS.

However, traditional rule-based methods struggle to detect novel anomalies. This paper leverages large language models (LLMs) for workflow anomaly detection by exploiting their ability to learn complex data patterns. Two approaches are investigated: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on labeled data for sentence classification to identify anomalies, and 2) in-context learning (ICL) where prompts containing task descriptions and examples guide LLMs in few-shot anomaly detection without fine-tuning. The paper evaluates the performance, efficiency, generalization of SFT models, and explores zero-shot and few-shot ICL prompts and interpretability enhancement via chain-of-thought prompting. Experiments across multiple workflow datasets demonstrate the promising potential of LLMs for effective anomaly detection in complex executions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 14 figures, paper is accepted by SC'24, source code, see: https://github.com/PoSeiDon-Workflows/LLM_AD</p></details> |
| **[PromptAD: Learning Prompts with only Normal Samples for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05231v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision-language model has brought great improvement to few-shot industrial anomaly detection, which usually needs to design of hundreds of prompts through prompt engineering. For automated scenarios, we first use conventional prompt learning with many-class paradigm as the baseline to automatically learn prompts but found that it can not work well in one-class anomaly detection. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a one-class prompt learning method for few-shot anomaly detection, termed PromptAD. First, we propose semantic concatenation which can transpose normal prompts into anomaly prompts by concatenating normal prompts with anomaly suffixes, thus constructing a large number of negative samples used to guide prompt learning in one-class setting. Furthermore, to mitigate the training challenge caused by the absence of anomaly images, we introduce the concept of explicit anomaly margin, which is used to explicitly control the margin between normal prompt features and anomaly prompt features through a hyper-parameter. For image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection, PromptAD achieves first place in 11/12 few-shot settings on MVTec and VisA.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

Compared to 2D few-shot anomaly detection (2D-FSAD), 3D few-shot anomaly detection (3D-FSAD) is still an unexplored but essential task. In this paper, we propose CLIP3D-AD, an efficient 3D-FSAD method extended on CLIP. We successfully transfer strong generalization ability of CLIP into 3D-FSAD. Specifically, we synthesize anomalous images on given normal images as sample pairs to adapt CLIP for 3D anomaly classification and segmentation. For classification, we introduce an image adapter and a text adapter to fine-tune global visual features and text features. Meanwhile, we propose a coarse-to-fine decoder to fuse and facilitate intermediate multi-layer visual representations of CLIP. To benefit from geometry information of point cloud and eliminate modality and data discrepancy when processed by CLIP, we project and render point cloud to multi-view normal and anomalous images. Then we design multi-view fusion module to fuse features of multi-view images extracted by CLIP which are used to facilitate visual representations for further enhancing vision-language correlation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has a competitive performance of 3D few-shot anomaly classification and segmentation on MVTec-3D AD dataset.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Adapting Visual-Language Models for Generalizable Anomaly Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12570v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale visual-language pre-trained models have led to significant progress in zero-/few-shot anomaly detection within natural image domains. However, the substantial domain divergence between natural and medical images limits the effectiveness of these methodologies in medical anomaly detection. This paper introduces a novel lightweight multi-level adaptation and comparison framework to repurpose the CLIP model for medical anomaly detection. Our approach integrates multiple residual adapters into the pre-trained visual encoder, enabling a stepwise enhancement of visual features across different levels. This multi-level adaptation is guided by multi-level, pixel-wise visual-language feature alignment loss functions, which recalibrate the model's focus from object semantics in natural imagery to anomaly identification in medical images. The adapted features exhibit improved generalization across various medical data types, even in zero-shot scenarios where the model encounters unseen medical modalities and anatomical regions during training. Our experiments on medical anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art models, with an average AUC improvement of 6.24% and 7.33% for anomaly classification, 2.03% and 2.37% for anomaly segmentation, under the zero-shot and few-shot settings, respectively.

| **[COFT-AD: COntrastive Fine-Tuning for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18998v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches towards anomaly detection~(AD) often rely on a substantial amount of anomaly-free data to train representation and density models. However, large anomaly-free datasets may not always be available before the inference stage; in which case an anomaly detection model must be trained with only a handful of normal samples, a.k.a. few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD). In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to address the challenge of FSAD which incorporates two important techniques. Firstly, we employ a model pre-trained on a large source dataset to initialize model weights. Secondly, to ameliorate the covariate shift between source and target domains, we adopt contrastive training to fine-tune on the few-shot target domain data. To learn suitable representations for the downstream AD task, we additionally incorporate cross-instance positive pairs to encourage a tight cluster of the normal samples, and negative pairs for better separation between normal and synthesized negative samples. We evaluate few-shot anomaly detection on on 3 controlled AD tasks and 4 real-world AD tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |

To address the challenges of data collection, researchers have introduced zero-/few-shot anomaly detection techniques that require minimal normal images for each category. However, complex industrial scenarios often involve multiple objects, presenting a significant challenge. In light of this, we propose a straightforward yet powerful multi-scale memory comparison framework for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection. Our approach employs a global memory bank to capture features across the entire image, while an individual memory bank focuses on simplified scenes containing a single object. The efficacy of our method is validated by its remarkable achievement of 4th place in the zero-shot track and 2nd place in the few-shot track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>VAND ...</summary><p>VAND Runner-up Winner in CVPR 2023</p></details> |
| **[Produce Once, Utilize Twice for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12913v1)** | 2023-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly detection aims at classifying and locating the regions that deviate from the normal appearance. Embedding-based methods and reconstruction-based methods are two main approaches for this task. However, they are either not efficient or not precise enough for the industrial detection. To deal with this problem, we derive POUTA (Produce Once Utilize Twice for Anomaly detection), which improves both the accuracy and efficiency by reusing the discriminant information potential in the reconstructive network. We observe that the encoder and decoder representations of the reconstructive network are able to stand for the features of the original and reconstructed image respectively. And the discrepancies between the symmetric reconstructive representations provides roughly accurate anomaly information. To refine this information, a coarse-to-fine process is proposed in POUTA, which calibrates the semantics of each discriminative layer by the high-level representations and supervision loss. Equipped with the above modules, POUTA is endowed with the ability to provide a more precise anomaly location than the prior arts. Besides, the representation reusage also enables to exclude the feature extraction process in the discriminative network, which reduces the parameters and improves the efficiency. Extensive experiments show that, POUTA is superior or comparable to the prior methods with even less cost. Furthermore, POUTA also achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art few-shot anomaly detection methods without any special design, showing that POUTA has strong ability to learn representations inherent in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Anomaly Detection with Adversarial Loss for Robust Feature Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03005v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a critical and challenging task that aims to identify data points deviating from normal patterns and distributions within a dataset. Various methods have been proposed using a one-class-one-model approach, but these techniques often face practical problems such as memory inefficiency and the requirement of sufficient data for training. In particular, few-shot anomaly detection presents significant challenges in industrial applications, where limited samples are available before mass production. In this paper, we propose a few-shot anomaly detection method that integrates adversarial training loss to obtain more robust and generalized feature representations. We utilize the adversarial loss previously employed in domain adaptation to align feature distributions between source and target domains, to enhance feature robustness and generalization in few-shot anomaly detection tasks. We hypothesize that adversarial loss is effective when applied to features that should have similar characteristics, such as those from the same layer in a Siamese network's parallel branches or input-output pairs of reconstruction-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method generally achieves better performance when utilizing the adversarial loss.</p></details> | BMVC 2023 |
| **[Few-shot Anomaly Detection in Text with Deviation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11780v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most current methods for detecting anomalies in text concentrate on constructing models solely relying on unlabeled data. These models operate on the presumption that no labeled anomalous examples are available, which prevents them from utilizing prior knowledge of anomalies that are typically present in small numbers in many real-world applications. Furthermore, these models prioritize learning feature embeddings rather than optimizing anomaly scores directly, which could lead to suboptimal anomaly scoring and inefficient use of data during the learning process. In this paper, we introduce FATE, a deep few-shot learning-based framework that leverages limited anomaly examples and learns anomaly scores explicitly in an end-to-end method using deviation learning. In this approach, the anomaly scores of normal examples are adjusted to closely resemble reference scores obtained from a prior distribution. Conversely, anomaly samples are forced to have anomalous scores that considerably deviate from the reference score in the upper tail of the prior. Additionally, our model is optimized to learn the distinct behavior of anomalies by utilizing a multi-head self-attention layer and multiple instance learning approaches. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach attains a new level of state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICONIP 2023</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing PatchCore for Few/many-shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10792v1)** | 2023-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (AD) is an emerging sub-field of general AD, and tries to distinguish between normal and anomalous data using only few selected samples. While newly proposed few-shot AD methods do compare against pre-existing algorithms developed for the full-shot domain as baselines, they do not dedicatedly optimize them for the few-shot setting. It thus remains unclear if the performance of such pre-existing algorithms can be further improved. We address said question in this work. Specifically, we present a study on the AD/anomaly segmentation (AS) performance of PatchCore, the current state-of-the-art full-shot AD/AS algorithm, in both the few-shot and the many-shot settings. We hypothesize that further performance improvements can be realized by (I) optimizing its various hyperparameters, and by (II) transferring techniques known to improve few-shot supervised learning to the AD domain. Exhaustive experiments on the public VisA and MVTec AD datasets reveal that (I) significant performance improvements can be realized by optimizing hyperparameters such as the underlying feature extractor, and that (II) image-level augmentations can, but are not guaranteed, to improve performance. Based on these findings, we achieve a new state of the art in few-shot AD on VisA, further demonstrating the merit of adapting pre-existing AD/AS methods to the few-shot setting. Last, we identify the investigation of feature extractors with a strong inductive bias as a potential future research direction for (few-shot) AD/AS.</p></details> |  |

Such techniques require large amounts of training data, resulting in computationally expensive algorithms that are unsuitable for settings where only a small amount of normal samples are available for training. We propose 'Few Shot anOMaly detection' (FewSOME), a deep One-Class Anomaly Detection algorithm with the ability to accurately detect anomalies having trained on 'few' examples of the normal class and no examples of the anomalous class. We describe FewSOME to be of low complexity given its low data requirement and short training time. FewSOME is aided by pretrained weights with an architecture based on Siamese Networks. By means of an ablation study, we demonstrate how our proposed loss, 'Stop Loss', improves the robustness of FewSOME. Our experiments demonstrate that FewSOME performs at state-of-the-art level on benchmark datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, F-MNIST and MVTec AD while training on only 30 normal samples, a minute fraction of the data that existing methods are trained on. Moreover, our experiments show FewSOME to be robust to contaminated datasets. We also report F1 score and balanced accuracy in addition to AUC as a benchmark for future techniques to be compared against.

| **[Meta-Learning Based Early Fault Detection for Rolling Bearings via Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12637v2)** | 2023-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early fault detection (EFD) of rolling bearings can recognize slight deviation of the health states and contribute to the stability of mechanical systems. In practice, very limited target bearing data are available to conduct EFD, which makes it hard to adapt to the EFD task of new bearings. To address this problem, many transfer learning based EFD methods utilize historical data to learn transferable domain knowledge and conduct early fault detection on new target bearings. However, most existing methods only consider the distribution drift across different working conditions but ignore the difference between bearings under the same working condition, which is called Unit-to-Unit Variability (UtUV). The setting of EFD with limited target data considering UtUV can be formulated as a Few-shot Anomaly Detection task. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel EFD method based on meta-learning considering UtUV. The proposed method can learn a generic metric based on Relation Network (RN) to measure the similarity between normal data and the new arrival target bearing data. Besides, the proposed method utilizes a health state embedding strategy to decrease false alarms. The performance of proposed method is tested on two bearing datasets. The results show that the proposed method can detect incipient faults earlier than the baselines with lower false alarms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The results require to be updated</p></details> |

Anomaly detection techniques are employed to identify these attacks and guarantee the normal operation of industrial CPS. However, it is still a challenging problem to cope with scenarios with few labeled samples. In this paper, we propose a few-shot anomaly detection model (FSL-PN) based on prototypical network and contrastive learning for identifying anomalies with limited labeled data from industrial CPS. Specifically, we design a contrastive loss to assist the training process of the feature extractor and learn more fine-grained features to improve the discriminative performance. Subsequently, to tackle the overfitting issue during classifying, we construct a robust cost function with a specific regularizer to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results based on two public imbalanced datasets with few-shot settings show that the FSL-PN model can significantly improve F1 score and reduce false alarm rate (FAR) for identifying anomalous signals to guarantee the security of industrial CPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Anomaly Crossing: New Horizons for Video Anomaly Detection as Cross-domain Few-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06320v3)** | 2022-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal events that occurred in videos. Since anomalous events are relatively rare, it is not feasible to collect a balanced dataset and train a binary classifier to solve the task. Thus, most previous approaches learn only from normal videos using unsupervised or semi-supervised methods. Obviously, they are limited in capturing and utilizing discriminative abnormal characteristics, which leads to compromised anomaly detection performance. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a new learning paradigm by making full use of both normal and abnormal videos for video anomaly detection. In particular, we formulate a new learning task: cross-domain few-shot anomaly detection, which can transfer knowledge learned from numerous videos in the source domain to help solve few-shot abnormality detection in the target domain. Concretely, we leverage self-supervised training on the target normal videos to reduce the domain gap and devise a meta context perception module to explore the video context of the event in the few-shot setting. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods on DoTA and UCF-Crime datasets, and the new task contributes to a more practical training paradigm for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

So far, existing FSAD studies follow the one-model-per-category learning paradigm used for standard AD, and the inter-category commonality has not been explored. Inspired by how humans detect anomalies, i.e., comparing an image in question to normal images, we here leverage registration, an image alignment task that is inherently generalizable across categories, as the proxy task, to train a category-agnostic anomaly detection model. During testing, the anomalies are identified by comparing the registered features of the test image and its corresponding support (normal) images. As far as we know, this is the first FSAD method that trains a single generalizable model and requires no re-training or parameter fine-tuning for new categories. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art FSAD methods by 3%-8% in AUC on the MVTec and MPDD benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2022 Oral; Code is available at https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/RegAD</p></details> |
| **[Discriminative Feature Learning Framework with Gradient Preference for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11014v1)** | 2022-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised representation learning has been extensively employed in anomaly detection, achieving impressive performance. Extracting valuable feature vectors that can remarkably improve the performance of anomaly detection are essential in unsupervised representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel discriminative feature learning framework with gradient preference for anomaly detection. Specifically, we firstly design a gradient preference based selector to store powerful feature points in space and then construct a feature repository, which alleviate the interference of redundant feature vectors and improve inference efficiency. To overcome the looseness of feature vectors, secondly, we present a discriminative feature learning with center constrain to map the feature repository to a compact subspace, so that the anomalous samples are more distinguishable from the normal ones. Moreover, our method can be easily extended to anomaly localization. Extensive experiments on popular industrial and medical anomaly detection datasets demonstrate our proposed framework can achieve competitive results in both anomaly detection and localization. More important, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in few shot anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Deep Few-shot Anomaly Detection with Deviation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00462v1)** | 2021-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing anomaly detection paradigms overwhelmingly focus on training detection models using exclusively normal data or unlabeled data (mostly normal samples). One notorious issue with these approaches is that they are weak in discriminating anomalies from normal samples due to the lack of the knowledge about the anomalies. Here, we study the problem of few-shot anomaly detection, in which we aim at using a few labeled anomaly examples to train sample-efficient discriminative detection models. To address this problem, we introduce a novel weakly-supervised anomaly detection framework to train detection models without assuming the examples illustrating all possible classes of anomaly. Specifically, the proposed approach learns discriminative normality (regularity) by leveraging the labeled anomalies and a prior probability to enforce expressive representations of normality and unbounded deviated representations of abnormality. This is achieved by an end-to-end optimization of anomaly scores with a neural deviation learning, in which the anomaly scores of normal samples are imposed to approximate scalar scores drawn from the prior while that of anomaly examples is enforced to have statistically significant deviations from these sampled scores in the upper tail. Furthermore, our model is optimized to learn fine-grained normality and abnormality by top-K multiple-instance-learning-based feature subspace deviation learning, allowing more generalized representations. Comprehensive experiments on nine real-world image anomaly detection benchmarks show that our model is substantially more sample-efficient and robust, and performs significantly better than state-of-the-art competing methods in both closed-set and open-set settings. Our model can also offer explanation capability as a result of its prior-driven anomaly score learning.

In this work, we consider the setting of few-shot anomaly detection in images, where only a few images are given at training. We devise a hierarchical generative model that captures the multi-scale patch distribution of each training image. We further enhance the representation of our model by using image transformations and optimize scale-specific patch-discriminators to distinguish between real and fake patches of the image, as well as between different transformations applied to those patches. The anomaly score is obtained by aggregating the patch-based votes of the correct transformation across scales and image regions. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on both the one-shot and few-shot settings, on the datasets of Paris, CIFAR10, MNIST and FashionMNIST as well as in the setting of defect detection on MVTec. In all cases, our method outperforms the recent baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

These approaches tend to be sensitive to outliers that lie relatively close to inliers (e.g., a colonoscopy image with a small polyp). In this paper, we address the inappropriate sensitivity to outliers by also learning from inliers. We propose a new few-shot anomaly detection method based on an encoder trained to maximise the mutual information between feature embeddings and normal images, followed by a few-shot score inference network, trained with a large set of inliers and a substantially smaller set of outliers. We evaluate our proposed method on the clinical problem of detecting frames containing polyps from colonoscopy video sequences, where the training set has 13350 normal images (i.e., without polyps) and less than 100 abnormal images (i.e., with polyps). The results of our proposed model on this data set reveal a state-of-the-art detection result, while the performance based on different number of anomaly samples is relatively stable after approximately 40 abnormal training images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept at MICCAI 2020</p></details> |
